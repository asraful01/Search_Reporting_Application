# Search_Reporting_Application
1.Create a website which will be used to house SARA, as well as other pertinent information (see “Website/Homepage” below).
2. Display hard-coded search results about a topic of your choice.
3. Display search results read from files stored in CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
4. Display search results obtained from using the Google Search API
5.Display search results from your own search engine which indexes the entire content of webpages. (Details about the search engine will be provided later in the semesters when we discuss databases and server-side programming.) Administration screens related to this search engine will also be needed.
Website/Homepage:
The home page should have at least the following four high-level menu options.
 Course, with a submenu item to point to the course Zybook. Additional course-related submenu items may be added later.
 Search – with submenu items to the various search modes specified in the Overview. This will obviously be the most important functional area of the site.
 Browser – with submenu items linking to pages with information about the browser, window, screen, location, geolocation, etc. (see https://www.w3schools.com/js/ and scroll down to “JS Browser BOM” in left nav bar) to get ideas as well as relevant code snippets
About – with submenu items to descriptions of the student-developers of the page and a “Contact Us” to contact them by e-mail. (If you don’t want your real email posted, you can create a Mailinator or other emailing alias system that will forward to your real email.)
